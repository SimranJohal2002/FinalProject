Some things to get this working:

Download the three datasets into this directory. The song prototype should just be a csv in this directory. The book prototype should be downloaded into a folder called "boos_data" and the movies should be in a folder called "ml-25m". If confused look at the three ipynb files to see/change where the datasets should be placed.

Movie dataset: https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/
Book dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhbagchi/books-dataset/data
Song dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/notshrirang/spotify-million-song-dataset
